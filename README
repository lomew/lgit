Emacs mode to work with GIT.  Intended to assist with day-to-day commits
by making it easy to see the working tree status and add changes for commit.

Under construction, adapting from my older lsvn.el.

Commands:

M-x lgit-status
	This is the main entry point.  Runs git status --porcelain

n/p		next-line/previous-line
m/u		mark/unmark
+/-		stage/unstage
R		discard (aka revert) local changes (requires confirm)
d		diff working tree (show diffs of unstaged changes)
D		diff index (show diffs of what is staged)
C		commit index, prompts for log
g		refresh the status buffer
G		run lgit-status, useful for going to another repository
f,RET		find-file under cursor
o		find-file under cursor, other window
B		switch or create branches
C-c C-k		kill running status process

Diff buffers use Emacs' diff-mode, which has various keybindings that
are worth pointing out:

n/p		next-hunk/previous-hunk
o,RET		goto-source
g		revert-buffer (refreshes the diff, useful when
		 cleaning up your patch)
C-c C-a		diff-apply-hunk (applies or backs out a hunk)
C-c C-s		diff-split-hunk (useful for reducing a hunk in
		  preparation for backing out with with C-c C-a,
		  like some temp testing code)
